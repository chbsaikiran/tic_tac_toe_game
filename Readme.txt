Create all the necessary files and code to build a chrome extension which enable two user to play a tic tac toe game. Lets keep two buttons one generate pin and other enter pin. when one of the two user clicks generate pin button then a random pin of 5 digit number is generated which the other player can enter by clicking the enter pin button. Once this is done the game should be started. The user who generated a pin will start first. After the game is over you have declare the winner between the two user. and then you should show two buttons restart the game or end connection. When restart game is clicked then you should allow the two users to start the game again no need to generate pin again just maintain the connection but the gmae is restarted, each time the game is restart the user who will start the first move will alternate.
